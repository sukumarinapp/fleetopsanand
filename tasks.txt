"The grid beneath the map shall be dedicated for alerts. There are principally 4 alerts which are raised whenever there is a business-critical situation. They are as follows:
1. Vehicle (Tracker) Offline
2. Vehicle Blocked
3. Vehicle Buzzer Active
4. Battery Power Cut

The grid shall have the following headers:
a. Event Date/Time
b. Vehicle Reg# (Hyperlinked such that when tapped it displays a tool-tip-text of a brief summary of the vehicle's situation: 
          - Vehicle Reg#
          - Vehicle Make/Model/Color
          - Customer Name
          - Manager Name
          - Driver Name (Or None)
          - Business (Or None)
c. Alert 
d. Hours-in-Effect (Records time in hours since the alarm was made active)
e. Event Location (Provides the Long./Lat. coordinates and hyperlinked such that when tapped it opens a Google map with a pin-drop showing where the event took place. From Google the user can then navigate to the location with directions.)

Generally,
1. The alerts shall persist until resolved
2. When the alert has been resolved, it shall disappear from the grid.
3. The ""Alerts Log"" shall have all the headings of the grid plus an additional one: ""Resolved Date/Time"""
