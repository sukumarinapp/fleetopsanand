"Create a ""Notifications Log"" under ""reports menu item to indicate all messages sent by SMS, to whom the messages were sent and what the delivery status of those notifications are. (Should not contain messages sent to tracker).
Please,
1. Add driver name to grid
2. Combine date/time in one cell and name that column ""Sent Date/Time""
3. Rename the ""Event"" column as ""Delivery Status""
4. Enable the delivery status to auto-update i.e., sent....delivered....not delivered etc...
"Is the status=""Delivered"" a true reflection of actual delivery status or is it just that the message was sent from the software?
This is a LEGAL issue:
Is the delivery status the same as what is logged on mNotify?"

While in Admin account, consider putting Password on "Settings" before access granted to the sub-listed menu items.
